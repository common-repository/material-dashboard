Professional material dashboard for WordPress!

== Description ==

Let your users manage their accounts and transactions for both WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads plugins. [See demo](https://amatris.ir/amd/demo/en_US)

== Installation ==

To install the plugin, you'll need to download the .zip file and upload it to your plugins from the 'Plugins' page in the admin dashboard. Once uploaded, enable the plugin if it hasn't been enabled automatically.
Note that on enabling the plugin for the first time, everything sets up automatically, and you don't have to do anything. However, if the database and pages weren't created automatically, follow these steps:

1. A new menu item named 'Dashboard' appears in the wp-admin page. Click on it and confirm the alert message to update the database.
2. Go to 'Settings' submenu and open the 'Pages' tab. Select dashboard pages from your existing pages or click on 'Create Automatically' button if there is no published page.

If you have decided to remove this plugin and we were unable to assist you in resolving your issue, it's important to clean up the plugin's data (including database tables and uploads) before deleting it. Follow these simple steps to do so:

1. Click on 'Manage Data' submenu and open the 'Cleanup' tab.
2. Select the items you wish to delete permanently or choose 'Select All'.
3. Click on the 'Cleanup' button and wait for the alert indicating whether the clean-up was successful or not.
* IMPORTANT: Do not visit any other dashboard pages in admin as this may cause the database tables and other files to be re-created. Instead, open the 'Plugins' page directly and remove the plugin from there.

Once you have completed these steps, the plugin will be removed completely from your system. We recommend taking a backup before proceeding, in case you need to restore the plugin in the future.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize my dashboard? =

Customizing your dashboard is easy and can be done from the settings. You can change the primary color, icons, and other elements to match your preferences. Additionally, you can choose from a selection of themes to personalize your dashboard even further. Although there is currently only one theme available in this version, we are continuously working to add more options. Try experimenting with the different customization features to create a dashboard that suits your style and needs.

= I can't find my language? =

At our company, we're committed to internationalizing our content and making it accessible to a wider audience. However, we recognize that our team has limited resources and, currently, only supports English and Persian languages in our plugins. To expand our reach, we're actively seeking contributions from users who can provide translations in other languages.
We believe that high-quality translations are critical to ensuring our content is accessible to all, which is why we're committed to avoiding the use of automated translation tools like Google Translate. Instead, we're investing in hiring professional translators who can help us deliver accurate, nuanced translations that truly resonate with our users.
If you're interested in contributing translations or know someone who might be a great fit for our team, please reach out to us. We'd love to work with you to make our content more accessible and inclusive for everyone. To contribute, we kindly request that you provide the translation files in .mo or .po format.

= Is this plugin safe? =

At our company, we take the security and privacy of our users' data very seriously. That's why we've implemented multiple levels of protection to safeguard your information. Our download links are completely private, and all user data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. In addition, we limit permissions to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data. We also avoid collecting any unnecessary data to further enhance the security of our users. You can trust that your information is in safe hands with us.

= Will you collect any data from my site? =

At your first installation you can choose to share your data or not and we respect your choice, if you accept to share your data with us in purpose of improvements, we only will collect data from this plugin database tables and nowhere else. You can also disable data-sharing at any time.
